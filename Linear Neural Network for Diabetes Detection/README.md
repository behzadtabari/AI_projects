- **Description**
the Data provided in diabetes are randomly set so the results are not correct, but if one could find some real data
then he/she can use the Network to predict his/her Diabetes whether it's positive or negative, for now I have set two
data that tests and prints in the Console, feel free to change the diabetes_test.csv.
